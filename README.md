# Visualize

This is a passion project for my hackathon about making visuals that help others learn. 
As an example, I made a physics simulation that simulates planets in plnetary motion following Kepler's Laws of Motion.
In addition, the background starts by having the planets move with an initial velocity set by a Perlin Noise Algorithm 
(An Algorithm that makes smooth noise like the terrain in Minecraft). 
This is all hosted using cloudflare and github pages using vite, ts and react.
