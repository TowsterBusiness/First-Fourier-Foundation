# Visualize

This is for my new hackathon about making visuals that help others learn!

As an example, I made a physics simulation that simulates planets in plnetary motion using **Kepler's Laws of Motion**.
AND... the background starts by having the planets move with an initial velocity set by a **Perlin Noise Algorithm**.
(An Algorithm that makes smooth noise like the terrain in Minecraft).

This is all hosted using cloudflare and github pages using vite, ts and react.
